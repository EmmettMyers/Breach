Breach is a platform that connects AI model creators with security testers to identify vulnerabilities through controlled jailbreaking attempts, with economic incentives powered by stablecoins.<br/><br/>

Core Features:
 - <strong>Model Exploration & Discovery</strong> - Browse, search, filter, and sort AI models by type, prize range, ownership status, and jailbreak status.
 - <strong>AI Model Creation</strong> - Create and deploy AI models with customizable system prompts, model types, prompt costs, and jailbreak prize pools.
 - <strong>Jailbreaking Interface</strong> - Chat interface for testing models with pay-per-prompt stablecoin payments and real-time jailbreak detection.
 - <strong>Stablecoin Integration (SBC)</strong> - Wallet connection with smart account support, gasless transactions via paymaster, and real-time balance tracking.
 - <strong>Prize Pool Management</strong> - Model owners can deposit and withdraw funds from prize pools, with automatic distribution on successful jailbreaks.
 - <strong>Statistics & Analytics</strong> - Track user performance metrics including prompts, jailbreak success rates, earnings, ROI, and model-specific statistics.
 - <strong>Wallet Management</strong> - Multi-wallet support with network switching, smart account initialization, and wallet status indicators.
